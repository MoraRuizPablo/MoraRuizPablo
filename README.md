Hi I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of South Bohemia in Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic, working on lepidoptera sex-chromosomes evolution. 

I am interested also in repetitive elements (TEs and satDNA) in other organisms such as coccinellids, kissing bugs, ants...

Growing, learning, discovering many things about bioinformatics
